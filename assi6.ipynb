    "Good afternoon, ma’am. This program is a simple Tic-Tac-Toe game written in Python that allows two players to play against each other on the same computer. It uses basic programming concepts like loops, functions, lists, and condition checking to create an interactive game.\n",
    "\n",
    "First, I define the function print_board(board). This function displays the current game board on the screen in a 3×3 grid format. Inside it, I first print a blank line for spacing. Then I use a loop that runs three times — one for each row. For every row, I join its three elements using vertical bars | to create the board structure, and print them. If the row is not the last one, I print a separator line made of dashes \"---------\" to visually divide the rows. Finally, I print another blank line for better readability.\n",
    "\n",
    "Next, I define the function check_winner(board, player). This function checks if the given player, either ‘X’ or ‘O’, has won the game. First, it checks all three rows using a loop — if all cells in a row are equal to the player symbol, it returns True, meaning the player has won horizontally. Next, it checks all columns using another loop, by comparing the same column index across all three rows. If all three match the player’s symbol, it means the player has won vertically. Then, it checks both diagonals. The first diagonal is from the top-left to bottom-right, and the second diagonal is from the top-right to bottom-left. If either diagonal has the same symbol in all three positions, the player wins. If none of these conditions are true, the function returns False, meaning there’s no winner yet.\n",
    "\n",
    "After that, I define the function is_board_full(board). This function checks if the entire board is filled without any empty spaces. It uses a single line with the all() function to verify that every cell in every row is not equal to a space \" \". If all cells are filled, it returns True, meaning the game has ended in a draw; otherwise, it returns False.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, I define the main function play_tic_tac_toe(). This function contains the main game loop and controls the overall flow of the game. Inside it, I first create a 3×3 game board using a list comprehension: board = [[\" \" for _ in range(3)] for _ in range(3)]. This creates a grid of nine empty spaces. Then I set the starting player as \"X\".\n",
    "\n",
    "I print a welcome message and display the numbered board positions from 1 to 9 so that players can easily choose where they want to play. These numbers correspond to each cell on the board in a left-to-right, top-to-bottom order.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, I enter a while True loop, which keeps running until the game ends either in a win or a draw. Inside the loop, I first print the current board using print_board(board) and display whose turn it is. Then, I ask the player to enter a position between 1 and 9 using input(), and convert it into an integer.\n",
    "\n",
    "To handle wrong inputs, I use a try-except block. If the player enters something that’s not a number, a ValueError occurs, and the program prints “Invalid input” and asks again. If the number is outside the range 1 to 9, it also prints “Invalid position” and continues the loop.\n",
    "\n",
    "If the position is valid, I calculate the row and column where the move should be placed using divmod(move - 1, 3). This converts the position number into the correct row and column indices for the board. Then I check if the chosen cell is already taken. If it’s not empty, I show a message saying “Position already taken” and continue to the next iteration, asking for another move.\n",
    "\n",
    "If the cell is free, I place the current player’s symbol (‘X’ or ‘O’) on that cell by setting board[row][col] = current_player. After placing the symbol, I check if this move has made the player win using the check_winner() function. If it returns True, I print the final board and announce that the player has won, and then I break out of the loop to end the game.\n",
    "\n",
    "If there’s no winner, I check if the board is full using is_board_full(board). If all cells are filled and no one has won, it means the game is a draw, so I print “It’s a draw!” and break the loop.\n",
    "\n",
    "If neither of these conditions are met, I switch turns by changing the current_player variable. If it was \"X\", it becomes \"O\", and if it was \"O\", it becomes \"X\". This ensures that both players alternate turns correctly.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once the game ends, either by a win or a draw, the while loop stops and the program exits. Finally, the last line play_tic_tac_toe() calls the main function, which starts the entire game.\n",
    "\n",
    "So, in summary, this Python program creates a fully functional two-player Tic-Tac-Toe game. It displays the board, allows players to take turns entering moves, checks for wins and draws after each turn, and uses helper functions to keep the code clean and organized. It’s a great example of using loops, conditionals, functions, and lists to build a simple interactive game in Python."
