    "Good afternoon, ma’am. This program is based on the Breadth-First Search algorithm, also called BFS, and it is used here to find the shortest path in a maze from a starting point to a goal point.\n",
    "\n",
    "At the beginning, we import the deque function from the collections module. A deque is a special kind of list that allows us to add and remove elements efficiently from both ends, which is perfect for implementing a queue in BFS.\n",
    "\n",
    "Next, we define our maze as a two-dimensional list, where each element represents a cell. A 0 means an open or free space through which we can move, and a 1 means a wall which we cannot cross. Our maze is made up of five rows and five columns. For example, the first row [0, 0, 0, 1, 0] shows three open cells, then a wall, then another open cell.\n",
    "\n",
    "After that, we set our start position to (0, 0), which means the top-left corner of the maze, and our goal position to (4, 4), which means the bottom-right corner. These are the two points between which the BFS will find the shortest route.\n",
    "\n",
    "We then print the message “Maze layout (0=free, 1=wall)” to show the meaning of the numbers. Then we loop through each row in the maze and print it, so we can visually see the structure of the maze on the screen.\n",
    "\n",
    "Next, we define a function called bfs_shortest_path(grid, start, goal). Inside this function, we first get the number of rows and columns of the grid using len(grid) and len(grid[0]). This helps us check the maze boundaries later.\n",
    "\n",
    "Then we create a queue using deque([start]), which initially contains only the starting cell. BFS uses a queue to explore the maze level by level. We also create a dictionary called parents that will store from which cell we reached another cell. The start cell has no parent, so we set it as {start: None}.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now we start the main BFS loop using while queue:. This loop continues as long as there are cells left to explore. Inside the loop, we remove the leftmost cell from the queue using popleft(), and store it in a variable called current.\n",
    "\n",
    "If the current cell is equal to the goal, that means we have reached the destination, and we break out of the loop because we don’t need to search further.\n",
    "\n",
    "Otherwise, we split the current cell’s position into two variables r and c, which represent the row and column numbers. Then we check all four possible directions from the current cell — down, up, right, and left — using a for loop: (1, 0), (-1, 0), (0, 1), (0, -1). These pairs represent the changes in row and column when moving one step in each direction.\n",
    "\n",
    "For each direction, we calculate the new cell’s position using nr = r + dr and nc = c + dc, and store it as next_cell = (nr, nc).\n",
    "\n",
    "Then we check if this new cell is still inside the maze by ensuring nr and nc are within valid range. If it’s outside, we use continue to skip it. Next, we check if that cell is a wall (grid[nr][nc] == 1) or if it has already been visited (meaning it already exists in parents). If either is true, we skip that cell as well.\n",
    "\n",
    "If the new cell is free and not visited yet, we record that we reached this new cell from the current cell using parents[next_cell] = current. Then we add this new cell to the queue for further exploration.\n",
    "\n",
    "After the while loop ends, we return the parents dictionary, which now contains all the connections showing how we reached each cell from the start.\n",
    "\n",
    "Next, we define another function called reconstruct_path(parents, start, goal). This function is used to backtrack from the goal to the start using the information stored in the parents dictionary. If the goal cell is not in the dictionary, that means no path was found, so we return an empty list. Otherwise, we create an empty list called path and set current as the goal. We keep moving backwards by following each cell’s parent until we reach the start. Each cell we visit is added to the path list. Finally, we reverse the path because we built it backwards, and then return it.\n",
    "\n",
    "After defining these functions, we call bfs_shortest_path(maze, start, goal) to run the BFS and store the result in the parents variable. Then we call reconstruct_path(parents, start, goal) to get the actual shortest path from start to goal.\n",
    "\n",
    "We then print “Shortest path coordinates:” and display each step of the path with its coordinates using a for loop. We also print the total path length by subtracting one from the number of cells, because the number of moves is always one less than the number of cells in the path.\n",
    "\n",
    "Next, we create a copy of the maze called display_grid using list slicing. We use this to visually display the path on the maze without changing the original one. For every cell in the path, we replace its value with a * symbol to mark the route. Then we mark the start position with S and the goal position with G.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, we print the maze again with a clear explanation of the symbols — S for start, G for goal, * for the route, and 1 for walls. Then we print the maze row by row so that the path from start to goal is clearly visible.\n",
    "\n",
    "In short, this code uses the Breadth-First Search algorithm to explore the maze level by level, ensuring that the first time it reaches the goal, it has found the shortest possible path. The BFS guarantees this because it explores all neighboring cells evenly before moving further. At the end, we can see both the sequence of coordinates and the maze with the path visually marked."
