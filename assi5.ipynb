    "Good afternoon, ma’am. This program demonstrates how to solve the 8-puzzle problem using the Breadth-First Search (BFS) algorithm. The 8-puzzle is a classic problem where we have a 3×3 board containing tiles numbered from 1 to 8 and one blank space, represented by zero. The goal is to slide the tiles one by one until we reach the correct final arrangement. BFS is used here because it guarantees finding the solution in the fewest number of moves possible.\n",
    "\n",
    "First, I import deque from the collections module. A deque, or double-ended queue, allows us to efficiently add and remove elements from both ends and is ideal for implementing BFS.\n",
    "\n",
    "Next, I define two tuples, start_state and goal_state. The start_state represents the initial arrangement of the puzzle — here, the numbers are arranged with the blank space, zero, in the middle. The goal_state represents the desired final arrangement where all numbers are in order and the blank is in the bottom-right corner.\n",
    "\n",
    "After defining the states, I create a function called show_state(state). This function prints the 8-puzzle board in a 3×3 format so that we can clearly visualize each step. It loops through the state in groups of three numbers and prints them in rows using the join function.\n",
    "\n",
    "Next, I define another function called neighbors(state). This function generates all possible next states by moving the blank tile up, down, left, or right — wherever possible. Inside it, I first find the position of the blank tile using state.index(0). Then, I use divmod to convert this index into its row and column number, since the board is three tiles wide.\n",
    "\n",
    "I create an empty list named swaps to store the possible moves. If the blank is not on the top row, it can move up, so I append zero_index - 3. If it’s not on the bottom row, it can move down, so I append zero_index + 3. Similarly, if the blank is not in the first column, it can move left, and if it’s not in the last column, it can move right.\n",
    "\n",
    "Then, for each possible move stored in swaps, I make a copy of the current state and actually swap the blank tile with the tile at that position. I use a Python trick to swap their positions in one line. After swapping, I convert the list back to a tuple and use yield to generate this as a new possible puzzle state. So, this function gives all valid next states from the current one.\n",
    "\n",
    "Next, I define the function solve_puzzle(start, goal). This is where the BFS search happens. I start by creating a queue using deque([start]), which initially contains only the start state. I also create a dictionary called parents, which keeps track of which state we came from, so that we can later reconstruct the full path to the goal. The start state’s parent is set to None since it has no previous state.\n",
    "\n",
    "Then I start a loop — while queue: — that runs until the queue becomes empty. Inside it, I take out the front element using popleft() and store it as current. If this current state matches the goal state, it means the puzzle is solved, and I break out of the loop.\n",
    "\n",
    "If not, I generate all possible next moves using neighbors(current). For each neighbor state, if it is not already in the parents dictionary, it means it hasn’t been visited yet. So, I record that its parent is the current state, and I add this neighbor state to the queue for further exploration. This process continues level by level, just like a BFS tree, ensuring we find the shortest solution path.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once the BFS completes, I return the parents dictionary that contains the path connections between states.\n",
    "\n",
    "After that, I define another function called reconstruct_moves(parents, start, goal). This function rebuilds the entire sequence of puzzle states from the goal back to the start. It first checks if the goal is present in the dictionary; if not, it means no solution exists. Otherwise, it starts from the goal state and keeps moving to its parent, appending each state to a list called path. When the start state is reached, we reverse this list to get the correct order — from start to goal — and return it.\n",
    "\n",
    "Next, I call the solve_puzzle function with the start and goal states and store the result in parents. Then I call reconstruct_moves to get the actual sequence of puzzle states that lead from the start to the goal.\n",
    "\n",
    "If no sequence is found, it prints “No solution found.” Otherwise, it prints the total number of moves required, which is simply the length of the sequence minus one, because the start position is not counted as a move. Then, for each step in the sequence, I print the step number and call the show_state function to display the 3×3 board layout. This allows us to see how the puzzle changes step by step until it reaches the final solved state.\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, this program uses the Breadth-First Search algorithm to explore all possible puzzle states level by level. It always expands the shallowest unvisited state first, which ensures that the first time it reaches the goal, it has found the shortest and fewest-move solution. This BFS-based approach is simple but very effective for small puzzles like the 8-puzzle problem."
