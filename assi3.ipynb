    "Good afternoon, ma’am. This program demonstrates the Depth First Search, or DFS, algorithm. DFS is used to explore all the nodes or places in a graph by going as deep as possible along one path before backtracking. In this program, we use a recursive approach, which means the function calls itself to keep exploring deeper nodes until it reaches the goal.\n",
    "\n",
    "First, we define the function depth_first_search(graph, start, goal). This function takes three arguments — the graph that represents all possible paths, the starting node from where we begin our search, and the goal node that we want to reach.\n",
    "\n",
    "Inside the function, I first create a set named visited, which will store all the nodes that have already been visited so that we don’t visit them again and cause infinite loops. Then, I create a list named order, which keeps track of the sequence in which the nodes are visited, and another list named path, which will store the current route from the start node to the goal node.\n",
    "\n",
    "Next, I define another function inside it called dfs(node). This is a helper recursive function that performs the actual depth-first traversal. It will be called repeatedly for each connected node in the graph.\n",
    "\n",
    "Inside this dfs function, the first step checks if the current node is already in the visited set. If yes, that means we’ve already explored it, so we return False and skip further exploration from this node.\n",
    "\n",
    "If it’s not visited, we add the node to the visited set using visited.add(node) and also record it in the order list using order.append(node). This helps us remember the order in which DFS visited the nodes. We also add it to the path list because it’s part of our current search path.\n",
    "\n",
    "Then we check if the current node is the same as our goal node using if node == goal:. If it matches, that means we’ve successfully reached the destination, so we return True to indicate that the goal has been found.\n",
    "\n",
    "If not, we loop through all the neighboring nodes connected to this node using for neighbor in graph[node]:. For each neighbor, we recursively call dfs(neighbor) to explore it deeply. The recursion means that the function keeps calling itself, going deeper and deeper into the graph. If any of these recursive calls returns True, it means the goal has been found somewhere down that branch, so we also return True immediately to stop further searching.\n",
    "\n",
    "If none of the neighbors leads to the goal, that means this particular path is not correct. So, we remove the last node from the path using path.pop() to backtrack — this step is very important in DFS. It helps the algorithm go back one step and try a different branch. Finally, we return False because this branch did not lead to the goal.\n",
    "\n",
    "After defining the recursive function, we call it once with the starting node using dfs(start). This begins the depth-first exploration from the start point. Once the recursive process finishes, the function returns two things — the complete order of node visits and the final path from start to goal.\n",
    "\n",
    "Outside the function, we call it like this:\n",
    "visit_order, goal_path = depth_first_search(game_map, start_location, target_location).\n",
    "Here, game_map is the graph of locations, start_location is where we begin, and target_location is the goal we are trying to reach, for example, a treasure or target point.\n",
    "\n",
    "Then, we print the heading “Visit order as DFS explores the map”, and use a for loop to display each node in the order it was visited by the DFS, with its step number. This helps us understand how DFS travels deeply before backtracking.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, we check if a valid goal path was found. If the path exists and the last node in the path matches the target location, we print the message “Path to the treasure” followed by the complete route joined with arrows. Otherwise, if the goal was never reached, we print that the goal is not reachable from the given starting point.\n",
    "\n",
    "So, in summary, this program performs a Depth First Search using recursion. It goes as deep as possible from the starting node, explores each possible route, backtracks when necessary, and finally prints both the order of exploration and the final path to the goal if it exists. This method is often used in solving mazes, puzzles, and graph traversals where we need to explore all paths systematically."
