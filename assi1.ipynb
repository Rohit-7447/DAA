    "Ma’am, this program finds a route from Home to Bakery using Greedy Best-First Search. I first import heappush and heappop to manage a priority queue. Then I define city_graph, which lists each city and the travel time to its neighbors, and heuristic_to_goal, which estimates how far each city is from Bakery, with Bakery set to zero.\n",
    "I define greedy_best_first(graph, heuristic, start, goal). Inside, I create a frontier heap and push the start node with its heuristic and the starting path. I also make a visited set and an order list to track the visit sequence. While the frontier isn’t empty, I pop the city with the smallest heuristic. If it was already visited, I skip it. Otherwise, I mark it visited and record it in order. If it’s the goal, I compute the real total cost by summing the edges along the path and return the path, cost, and visit order. If not the goal, I push all unvisited neighbors into the heap with their heuristic and the extended path. If no goal is found, I return no path and infinity cost.\n",
    "Finally, I call the function from Home to Bakery, print the visit order, and, if a path exists, I print the chosen route and total travel time.”"
